title: "react native ntu - class 1 "
---
today was the first class of the react native class at ntu! i understood everything and was so glad that my friend Siao was able to take this in-person course with me! the teacher went at a slow (which is better than fast) pace that i didn't needed to type fast and there were only 6-7 in the class (which is great cuz small class size)! we got set up with expo and made a simple screen that shows alerts / image / [constants](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/constants/) (which displays the device's name)

one thing that i learned that i didn't know before was that you can write inline styles in the app.js file by declaring a const and then just put in in the JSX tag like 

```javascript
style = {styles.img}
```

i really want to be able to make a simple book app like [this](https://www.instamobile.io/react-native-tutorials/react-native-app-ideas-beginners/) by the end of the 3-week course but i don't know if the fundamentals will be able to carry me through! also, i hope that i will be able to keep on following along even in the 2nd class and beyond. i am afraid of falling behind when he starts teaching more complex stuff! 

so glad that this class is project based though but not theory-only! i will have to [put the project on github](https://funnelgarden.com/import-github/) tomorrow sometimes hehe for safekeeping's sake.
