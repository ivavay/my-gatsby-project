title: what learning react has taught me
---
Wow! It truly has been a hot minute since I've blogged on here. Can't believe the last time I wrote on here was when I was still in Taiwan! 

I've been getting back into coding after school started winding down a bit mid-May. Over the past month or so, I've been brushing up on JS through making a few small projects and started learning react again! This second time around, I'm using the Udemy course from Stephen Grider mostly and it's been so helpful! I love the little practical projects that we've been doing for the first couple of hours, such as the location-based weather checker and the image search gallery using the Unsplash API. I think I'll wrap up that image gallery project up tomorrow :) 

For the majority of today, I've been coding along with Maximillion's 4-hour React Crash Course video on Youtube. His example was a meetup site where you could meetups to it so naturally I thought of tweaking that to a dev notes adding log where I could document my learnings each day. However, after remembering that this blog is already set up in such good form in Gatsby and Netlify CMS, I think I'm just going to use the knowledge attained from going through that example to remake an alternative portfolio site for myself, partially for practice and maybe not for professional use. It depends up how well the site could be made with my limited react skills because I don't want to sacrifice my design case studies for poor implementations. 

In terms of how learning react has influenced my perspectives on design, I think the most important thing that I want to start doing in my Figma files is to use components and component varients. I also need to start naming and framing / grouping my layers better. I wish there's more articles or resources on best designer / developer collaborations. Maybe I'll rewatch the Designing for Code video from Figma Config and see if there's any insightful nuggets from there.
