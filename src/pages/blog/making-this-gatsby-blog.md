title: making this gatsby blog
---
> hello! so it took me half a day (plus another few hours yesterday night) to figure out how to make a blog with netifly and gatsby! i read a few articles and then found this [article](https://dev.to/thatgalnatalie/how-to-use-netlify-as-your-cms-for-your-gatsby-blog-6jm) to be super helpful and straightword in helping me go through all the steps of setting up the working blog. the most trouble that i had was figuring the right file path so that the posts can be generated in the right folder. i first tried src/pages/blog inside of the file config.yml (which didn't work) and then i tried putting qoutes around it (which didn't work either). then, after creating 7 posts in the wrong blog folder, i just deleted the folder all together and it worked! i saw the default posts in the CMS and was able to see the newly created posts on the site!

> overall, i felt good that i was able to figure it out mostly on my own! thank you sophia li for helping me with ideas on how to debug this to make it work!
