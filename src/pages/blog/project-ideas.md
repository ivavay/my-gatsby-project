*this is an ongoing list of project ideas for both dev and design. i want to work on at least one of them in 2021.*

\- [book app](https://www.instamobile.io/react-native-tutorials/react-native-app-ideas-beginners/) (reactive native) 

\- a podcast app -> something that helps people retain info on podcasts better through highlights and notes, see [Airr](https://www.airr.io/) they're already doing something similar (design project + reactive native?) 

\- a time-lock holiday advent calender that gives you reflection writing prompts (react) 

\- a collaborative improv poetry game that saves the finished poem as a sharable jpg
